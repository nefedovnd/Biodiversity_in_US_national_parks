# Biodiversity in US national parks
Final portfolio project of Codecademy Data Science course.

The aim of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, precisely about different species observed across different national park locations.

This project will scope, prepare, analyze data and explain findings from the analysis.

Main question this project seeks to answer are:

- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
- What are the differences between types of species and conservation status?
- Which types of species are mostly protected?
- Which park has the largest number of observed endangered species?
- Which species are mostly endangered and how they distributed across national parks?

**Data sources:**

Both `Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).

Note: The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional.
